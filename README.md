🚀 4-Bit & 8-Bit ALU Calculator – Proteus Edition
Welcome to the Digital Logic Design Lab Project—a hands-on simulation of a powerful 4-bit and 8-bit ALU using Proteus. Whether you're crunching binary operations or designing logic-based systems, this ALU gives you a clean, modular, and simulation-ready workspace to master the fundamentals of digital logic!

🎯 What’s Inside?
This ALU project delivers:

Arithmetic Ops: Add, Subtract, Multiply

Logic Ops: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR

4-bit & 8-bit Variants: Two dedicated Proteus projects for small and large calculations

Fully Simulated: Run circuits, view outputs, and debug interactively in Proteus

Modular Setup: Organized project backups and workspace tracking for development flexibility

🕹️ How It Works
Give the ALU two inputs (A and B) using switches or HEX displays and select the operation via Opcode control. The ALU performs the operation and outputs the result through displays, LEDs, or digital probes.

Sample Operations:
Addition: A + B → Result + Carry

Subtraction: A - B → Result + Borrow

Logic Operations: A XOR B, A AND B, etc.
